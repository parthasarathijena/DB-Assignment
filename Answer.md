Ans 1 :- In the diagram, it seems to have a one to many relationship betwwen "Product" and "Product_Category" .This implies that each Production has only one Product_Category i.e category_id in the diagram, while each Product_Category can have mutiple Product in this we can see that Product_Category id(primary key) is associated to Product category_id(secondary key).



Ans 2 :- To ensure that each product in the "Product: table has valid category assigned to it by implementing a foreign key constraint. In the schema we can establish a foreign key relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" table. Since foreign key is placed on "many" side so we can make the category_id of Product foreign key having references with id of Product_Category.This way, we can enforce referential integrity, ensuring that every product is associated with a valid product category.
